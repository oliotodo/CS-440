Senior Seminar Shipyard Project

The Log-In page will be the home screen for Shipyard. It will have a dropdown menu to include the Contact Us and FAQ Pages. 

The Log-In will ask for a Bellarmine email address and a password associated with that email. For the interface, there will be a successful log-in and an unsuccessful log-in. After a successful log-in, it will show the Top 5 New Internships and the full range of menu items.
