Senior Seminar Shipyard Project

With the originally project, there was a plan to pull internships from different jobsites across the Internet. Since this is just front-end, will manually create internship opportunities, will possibly be nonsense, but a few that can be tested in terms of location and things like that.

Will have a list of internships avaliable. They will be in a table format, titles: position, company, location, when, and description. There will also be a place where the user can select the internship and a place to save as well. 

Will have a search feature, filter, sort, and map. User will be able to save the filters they chose. Map will switch to a map view of where the internships are posted. Being able to select multiple internships will allow for applying to multiple and comparison feature. 

Read more in the description will go to a full description of the internship: full description from the company's site, if paid or not and how much, when it will take place, last day the application can be submitted, full address which is linked to a map view, link to the company and any contact information they provided. There will be similar postings on the side and options to save the internship and apply to it.
