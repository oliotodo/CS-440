My Account is supposed to be unique to each user. Will have options to chose from: my resume, edit my account, saved internships, saved filters, application history, my semaphore posts, and log out of my account.

My resume: upload a resume (.doc, .docx, or .pdf only), view your resume, delete your resume and/or responses, responses to common application questions.

Edit my account: what email to send notifications to, which notifications are sent, and deletion of account.

Saved internships: list of saved internships and read more option.

Saved Filters: shows a list of what filters are saved. Option to delete one, multiple, or all.

Application history: shows which internships a user applied to and how many days ago it was.

My semaphore posts: shows your posts (date and topic as well), able to view posts, view replies, and delete.

Log out of my account: a simple yes or no. Goes to successful logout.
